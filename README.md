## Context and description

As I wanted to learn Rust and everything around it, I set myself an overly ambitious goal to see where it takes me. Because I am more of a sysadmin than a developper person, I decided to help administrators easily ("easy" is a very subjective notion) regulate and streamline the update flows of their Gnu/Linux hosts across an infrastructure. Instead of having multiple hosts downloading the same upgrades and stressing the organisation's internet connectivity, one local mirror of the repositories is available for them, depending on their distribution version and their position in the topology.

I am well aware that such a system has existed for a long time for "non-free environments". Also, it probably already exists for open source infrastructures as well and I am just not aware of it, but, since my goal here is to learn Rust (and its environment), I voluntarily didn't search for it and just started writing it myself.

I am releasing this tool as an open source project for the following reasons :
- it might actually help someone somewhere someday...
- maybe some sysadmin has an idea for improving this tool or a specific need and would be willing to talk about it
- hopefully some contributors may be interested in maintaining and improving this tool and make it evolve in something bigger, more secure and actually useful for organizations (why not)

## Usage
1. Fill the database with every host
2. Organize virtually your update flows by linking nodes in the database
3. Enforce your virtual structure through the server/agents
