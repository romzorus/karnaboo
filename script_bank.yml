# File format : YAML
# https://yaml.org/

# The _key value is necessary in the database.
# It is a MD5 hash obtained with :
#   echo "$(date)" | md5sum
# Since there is nothing definitive in a script, the hash
# is based on the date and time of the creation.
# 
#   echo "$(date)" | md5sum

# Guidelines to write the scripts content :
  # - can be executed multiple times without problem, meaning it has
  # to check whether the job is already done or not
  # - respect the YAML indentation
  # - " ' must be escaped \", as if it were
  # going to be printed by a "print!()"
